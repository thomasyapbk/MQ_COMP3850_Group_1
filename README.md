# MQ_COMP3850_Group_1

## Last Data Extract Date: APRIL 6th 2021 
### Discliamer - Due to privacy of the documents, we will not upload the actual files to GitHub but will clean the data before uploading for the group

This will be the GitHub Repository that we will be using for this project. I strongly suggest that everyone install the following programmes as soon as possible to view the initial sample report that I have uploaded.

We can also double this README Document as a way to keep track of the project contribution based on the push and pull requests and add in instructions on how to use the Jupyter Notebooks.

*Update 28/06/21*
Handing over this GitHub Page to the client of COMP3850 Group 1. Should there be any need for further clarification of the documents or the MVP. Do feel free to contact any of us in the team below through our student emails.
